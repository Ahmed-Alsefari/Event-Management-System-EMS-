# Event-Management-System-EMS-

The Problem: 

Customers face difficulties in organizing events and booking services because they often need to call or visit the company in person.
There is no centralized system to manage bookings, which can lead to delays, confusion, or errors.
Customers cannot easily view, edit, or cancel their bookings, and the manager has no simple way to track all reservations in one place.

The Proposed Solution:

All-in-one Online Platform: 
  •	Allow customers to book online. 
Customer Dashboard: 
  •	Review, edit, or cancel bookings. 
Admin Dashboard: 
  •	Manage all bookings in one place. 
  •	Send updates and notifications to customers. 
  •	Adjust pricing and services. 
Automated Notifications: 
  •	Send reminders via email or SMS. 
User-Friendly Interface: 
  •	Easy to navigate for all users.
